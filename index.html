        <blockquote><p>I wrote this post because I found that there wasn’t much information
          about how to use your home oven properly when baking macarons. Unlike spacious
          and sturdy commercial grade ovens with even heat distribution, home ovens can be
          temperamental and seem to need a lot of coddling. For any home baker, it’s very
          important to know their own oven well in order to achieve success with any recipe.
          You will need to experiment under different baking conditions like rack position,
          temperature and bake time to find the optimal conditions for successful baking.
          When you learn to trust your oven, it will love you back.</p></blockquote>

          <p>When I started making macarons, I was more concerned about feet development and
            just making sure that the macarons actually looked like macarons. Needless to say,
            I was not too picky back then. But as I baked more of them, I realized that all
            the faults like hollow shells, crispy over baked bodies etc. would actually
            manifest itself in its outer appearance. In other words, you are essentially
            showing the world all your macaron’s faults just by its visual presentation.
            I started to demand more perfection from these little sweet treats.  You know how
            I said before that I'll NEVER go back to the French method? Well, I was curious
            yesterday and wanted to see how I could make macarons less sweet. I noticed that
            since Ladurée, the well known founder of the cream-filled macaron, always gets such
            rave reviews I should try out their recipe. I was hesitant at first because I hate
            French method, most recipes I've used are terrible. But this one that I found from
            Not So Humble Pie was so good!!! I even ordered the Ladurée Sucré cookbook on amazon
            after I figured this out. The recipe is not too sweet at ALL. There is no sweet aftertaste,
            and it doesn't make you want to drink water. Probably because it is more airy and light. I
            thought that I would never like French method macarons, but good thing I tried this
            recipe. Of course, since Ladurée is the best of the best.

            This method is almost like a hybrid of French and Italian methods! I've never seen a recipe
            this good. I'm so glad I tried it out. I'm surprised that not too many people tried out this
            recipe when it's on Not So Humble Pie's blog and it's been there for a year. Thank you Ms.
            Humble! </p>
